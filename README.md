# Computer_Vision_Face_Landmarks_Detection
A simple implementation of facial features (face, eyes &amp; nose) recognition application using OpenCV library. 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a with creating a virtual environment. The files for operating system related environments are in folder called ***virtual_env_files***.


### Steps To Create a Virtual Environment

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Go to the ***virtual_env_files*** folder, and type the following command in your terminal. 

***If you are using mac use the below command***

```
conda env create -f virtual_environment_mac.yml
```

***If you are using windows use the below command***

```
conda env create -f virtual_environment_windows.yml
```

***If you are using mac use the below command***

```
conda env create -f virtual_environment_linux.yml
```

It will take some time to create and install all the virtual environment related packages & libraries. 


## Run the project

To run the project, all you have to do is select the facial_features_recognition.py file, and run it.
